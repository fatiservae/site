["\"A coward dies a thousand times before his death, but the valiant taste of death but once. It seems to me most strange that men should fear, seeing that death, a necessary end, will come when it will come.\u201d William Shakespeare, Julius Caesar","","\u201cIf anyone tells you that a certain person speaks ill of you, do not make excuses about what is said of you but answer, \"He was ignorant of my other faults, else he would not have mentioned these alone.\u201d Epictetus","","\u201cWealth consists not in having great possessions, but in having few wants.\u201d Epictetus","","\u201cDon't explain your philosophy. Embody it.\u201d Epictetus","","\"It's not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters.\" Epictetus","","\u201cThere is only one way to happiness and that is to cease worrying about things which are beyond the power or our will.\u201d Epictetus","","\u201cMen are disturbed not by things, but by the views which they take of things. Thus death is nothing terrible, else it would have appeared so to Socrates. But the terror consists in our notion of death, that it is terrible. When, therefore, we are hindered, or disturbed, or grieved let us never impute it to others, but to ourselves; that is, to our own views. It is the action of an uninstructed person to reproach others for his own misfortunes; of one entering upon instruction, to reproach himself; and of one perfectly instructed, to reproach neither others or himself.\u201d Epictetus","","\u201cFirst say to yourself what you would be; and then do what you have to do.\u201d Epictetus","","\u201cAny person capable of angering you becomes your master; he can anger you only when you permit yourself to be disturbed by him.\u201d Epictetus","","\u201cCircumstances don't make the man, they only reveal him to himself.\u201d  Epictetus","","\u201cHe is a wise man who does not grieve for the things which he has not, but rejoices for those which he has. \u201d Epictetus","","\u201cDon't seek to have events happen as you wish, but wish them to happen as they do happen, and all will be well with you.\u201d Epictetus","","\u201cGod has entrusted me with myself. No man is free who is not master of himself. A man should so live that his happiness shall depend as little as possible on external things.\u201d Epictetus","","\u201cKnow you not that a good man does nothing for appearance sake, but for the sake of having done right?\u201d Epictetus","","\u201cIf you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.\u201d Marcus Aurelius","","\u201cYou always own the option of having no opinion. There is never any need to get worked up or to trouble your soul about things you can't control. These things are not asking to be judged by you. Leave them alone.\u201d Marcus Aurelius","","\u201cYou have power over your mind not outside events. Realise this, and you will find strength.\u201d Marcus Aurelius","","\u201cWaste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one.\u201d Marcus Aurelius","","\u201cAccept the things to which fate binds you, and love the people with whom fate brings you together,but do so with all your heart.\u201d Marcus Aurelius","","\u201cNever let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present.\u201d Marcus Aurelius","","\u201cThe soul becomes dyed with the colour of its thoughts.\u201d Marcus Aurelius","","\u201cLive a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones.\u201d Marcus Aurelius","","\u201cHow much time he gains who does not look to see what his neighbour says or does or thinks, but only at what he does himself, to make it just and holy.\u201d Marcus Aurelius","","\u201cIf you live in harmony with nature you will never be poor; if you live according to what others think, you will never be rich.\u201d Seneca ","","\u201cTrue happiness is to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence upon the future, not to amuse ourselves with either hopes or fears but to rest satisfied with what we have, which is sufficient, for he that is so wants nothing. The greatest blessings of mankind are within us and within our reach. A wise man is content with his lot, whatever it may be, without wishing for what he has not.\u201d Seneca","","\u201cAll cruelty springs from weakness.\u201d Seneca","","\"The greatest obstacle to living is expectancy, which hangs upon tomorrow, and loses today. You are arranging what lies in Fortune's control, and abandoning what lies in yours. What are you looking at? To what goal are you straining? The whole future lies in uncertainty: live immediately.\u201d Seneca","","\"Nothing, to my way of thinking, is a better proof of a well ordered mind than a man\u2019s ability to stop just where he is and pass some time in his own company.\" Seneca","","\u201cA gift consists not in what is done or given, but in the intention of the giver or doer.\u201d Seneca","","\u201cYou act like mortals in all that you fear, and like immortals in all that you desire.\u201d Seneca","","\u201cIf a man knows not to which port he sails, no wind is favourable.\u201d Seneca","","\u201cIf you really want to escape the things that harass you, what you\u2019re needing is not to be in a different place but to be a different person.\u201d Seneca","","\u201cThey lose the day in expectation of the night, and the night in fear of the dawn.\u201d Seneca","","\u201cYou live as if you were destined to live forever, no thought of your frailty ever enters your head, of how much time has already gone by you take no heed. You squander time as if you drew from a full and abundant supply, though all the while that day which you bestow on some person or thing is perhaps your last.\u201d Seneca","","\u201cUntil we have begun to go without them, we fail to realise how unnecessary many things are. We've been using them not because we needed them but because we had them.\u201d Seneca","","\"Aceite tudo como \u00e9.\" Miyamoto Musashi \u5bae\u672c \u6b66\u8535","","\"N\u00e3o procure o prazer f\u00edsico para seu proprio partido.\" Miyamoto Musashi \u5bae\u672c \u6b66\u8535","","\"Em nenhuma circunst\u00e2ncia dependa de um sentimento parcial.\" Miyamoto Musashi \u5bae\u672c \u6b66\u8535","","\"Considere a si mesmo com leveza; considere o mundo com profundidade.\" Miyamoto Musashi \u5bae\u672c \u6b66\u8535","","\"Durante a sua vida, evita o desejo, at\u00e9 o proprio desejo de nada desejar.\" Miyamoto Musashi \u5bae\u672c \u6b66\u8535","","\"N\u00e3o lamente o que fez.\" Miyamoto Musashi \u5bae\u672c \u6b66\u8535","","\"N\u00e3o possua inveja.\" Miyamoto Musashi \u5bae\u672c \u6b66\u8535","","\"N\u00e3o se deixe entristecer por uma separa\u00e7\u00e3o.\" Miyamoto Musashi \u5bae\u672c \u6b66\u8535","","\"Ressentimento e reclama\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00e3o inadequadas tanto para si como para os outros.\" Miyamoto Musashi \u5bae\u672c \u6b66\u8535","","\"N\u00e3o deixe se guiar pelos sentimentos de luxuria ou amor.\" Miyamoto Musashi \u5bae\u672c \u6b66\u8535","","\"Em todas as coisas, n\u00e3o tenha preferencias.\" Miyamoto Musashi \u5bae\u672c \u6b66\u8535","","\"Seja indiferente ao local onde reside.\" Miyamoto Musashi \u5bae\u672c \u6b66\u8535","","\"N\u00e3o persiga o gosto da boa comida.\" Miyamoto Musashi \u5bae\u672c \u6b66\u8535","","\"N\u00e3o carregue bens que j\u00e1 n\u00e3o necessita.\" Miyamoto Musashi \u5bae\u672c \u6b66\u8535","","\"N\u00e3o aja de acordo com as cren\u00e7as habituais.\" Miyamoto Musashi \u5bae\u672c \u6b66\u8535","","\"N\u00e3o colecione ou pratique com armas para al\u00e9m do necess\u00e1rio.\" Miyamoto Musashi \u5bae\u672c \u6b66\u8535","","\"N\u00e3o tenha receio da morte.\" Miyamoto Musashi \u5bae\u672c \u6b66\u8535","","\"N\u00e3o tenha a inten\u00e7\u00e3o de possuir objetos ou um feudo na velhice.\" Miyamoto Musashi \u5bae\u672c \u6b66\u8535","","\"Respeite Buda e os deuses sem contar com o seu auxilio.\" Miyamoto Musashi \u5bae\u672c \u6b66\u8535","","\"Ainda que abandone sua vida, preserve a sua honra.\" Miyamoto Musashi \u5bae\u672c \u6b66\u8535","","\"Nunca se afaste do Caminho.\" Miyamoto Musashi \u5bae\u672c \u6b66\u8535","","\"Nothing is miserable unless you think it so.\" Boethius","","\"He who has calmly reconciled his life to fate ... can look fortune in the face.\" Boethius ","","\"Contemplate the extent and stability of the heavens, and then at last cease to admire worthless things.\" Boethius ","","\"In other living creatures the ignorance of themselves is nature, but in men it is a vice.\" Boethius","","\"Nunc fluens facit tempus, nunc stans facit aeternitatum.\" Boethius","","\"From the gods I received [...] that I was no great proficient in the study of rhetoric and poetry, and of other faculties, which perchance I might have dwelt upon, if I had found myself to go on in them with success.\" Marcus Aurelius","","\"A man should stand erected, not kept erected by others.\" Marcus Aurelius","","\"If we want to say that people are responsible, we must do nothing to infringe their freedom, since if they are not free to act they cannot be held responsible.
